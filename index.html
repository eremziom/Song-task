                            So long, I lie here entwined like a helix</br>
                            Don't know where I begin, where you end</br>
                            How long do we go on trying to feed it</br>
                            I just know, I just know, that this can't grow</br></br>
                            I wrote this song to tell you I'm leaving</br>
                            Afraid to say these words to your face</br>
                            Must be better than a letter a text or an email</br>
                            My right stops here at the end of the line.</br></br>
                            We stopped time, when we signed in the year, of our Lord, 1999</br>
                            With a kiss spitting out, spitting out, time lines</br>
                            From the moment we locked eyes at the station of our [?]</br>
                            Two reduced to one life, forever proposed, wicked like a land mine?</br></br>
                            I wrote this song to tell you I'm leaving</br>
                            Afraid to say these words to your face</br>
                            Must be better than a letter a text or an email</br>
                            My right stops here at the end of the line.</br></br>
                            Every kiss has lost its flavor</br>
                            I'm not proud of my behavior</br>
                            Beached on rock, thought that it was land</br>
                            Lost respect, love imparted</br>
                            what was fresh, we took for granted</br>
                            need to rely on more than just a friend</br></br>
                            I wrote this song to say that I'm leaving</br>
                            Afraid to say these words to your face</br>
                            Must be better than a letter a text or an email</br>
                            My right stops here at the end of this line.</br>
